Chewbotcca just reached 200 servers! Yay!

What do I plan to do for these amazing milestones?

Every hundred servers (or so), I will post a blog post, much like this one, about the future of the bot, and what to expect by 300 servers, or just the next milestone in general.

So, what's up and coming with the bot?

## Improved Meme DB submissions.

With the welcome of Chewbotcca Server Manager, he'll help us do new things. For example, once a new meme is submitted, it will go to vote on a channel, where users can approve or deny the meme.
If approved, the meme will be added! If denied, not so much.

## Improved ServerInfo and UserInfo

As we know, those commands are a mess, if you're familiar with bots like R. Danny and DuckHunt, they utilize reactions to "scroll" through pages of information.

I do not know how to organize it quite yet (or really anything else for that matter), but it's ok, we'll get there eventually.

## Actually post updates to the twitter.

Wait, there's a twitter? Yes! I made it so long ago but never touched it, probably should. If that's how you found this, oh.

[Here's the link](http://twitter.com/Chewbotcca).

## Import (most) commands from the IRC bot.

[Here's a list to those commands](http://irc.chewbotcca.co/commands).

The IRC bot is loaded with fun features and commands, I plan to bring those over to the bot in the times to come.
I have already brought over some lastfm commands, etc.

## Give users who voted some b o n u s p e r k s.

What these are, I have no idea. They already have some bonus features on the [support server](https://discord.gg/Q8TazNz), so it's only fair they get some from the bot as well.

If you haven't voted or joined the server yet, why wait? [Vote here](http://bit.ly/Vote4Chewbotcca).

If you don't already have the bot on your server, why wait? [Here's that invite link](http://bit.ly/Chewbotcca).

Thanks for reading, ~~I'm John Green~~ I'll see you at 300!
